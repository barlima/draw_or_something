__What we want to achieve__

### 1. Create an app to which a user can sign in using Google
### 2. Once a week an image is being selected (maybe from fickr ???) and set as a week picture
### 3. Users will draw that image and post (upload) their painting/drawings
### 4. Users should be able to upload only one picture during the week
### 5. Users can vote for other paintings
### 6. Voting is delayed by one week (i.e. you can vote for images from the previous week)
### 7. Winners should receive points for winning
### 8. Users should be able to see winners list (week by week)
### 9. Users should be able to see this week leading images
### 10. Users should be able to follow each others

## Ideas

Api and Frontend splitted

Api in Ruby (Rails, Sinatra or Hanami?) Hanami should be fun :)

Front in React (^16 - hooks)

DB can be Mongo or any other NoSQL DB

Api - GraphQL - Front

Images stored in S3 Bucket

Basic UI (Semantic UI)

UI should be responsive - mobile users

Dockerized ??? (maybe at the end of work - not enough space)
